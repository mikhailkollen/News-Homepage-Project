## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

During the project I had to implement a lot of previously learned concepts and tools.
It was my first time creating with CSS Grid, and although I had to fight with some of the properties, I liked it and will use it more from now on.
I also tried to create a simple animation of the .toggle-btn, by tweaking the opacity and rotation properties, and it worked out quite well.
I tried to smoothen the change of states when the .toggle-btn is clicked by applying some CSS and JS, so there are fewer sharp actions on the pages when a user interacts with it.
This time I paid more attention to the accessibility, so fewer divs were used.

### Continued development

I would like to continue polishing my skills of using Flexbox and Grid, and try combining and overwriting them when using media queries, in order to achieve better user experience on different devices.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's video on CSS Grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - This video gave me a very solid start with CSS Grid and provided me with the key concepts when using it.
